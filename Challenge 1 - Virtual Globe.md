# Challenge 1 – Convert the NASA Web World Wind (NWWW) to a virtual reality globe

* Use the NWWW API and WebVR API to produce a VR version of the globe
* Use Google Earth VR to present orbiting satellites and the ISS using streamed position data

NWWW Website:  https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov

# Web WorldWind

Create a web app or simply embed a globe in your page. For more information see the project's home page. To get right into the code, check out the Web WorldWind GitHub repository.

# WorldWind Android

Develop a world-class WorldWind application for your Android phone or tablet. Instructions, tutorials, and examples are available on the project's home page. The WorldWind Android GitHub repository contains the library and code.

WorldWind Java

Build a cross-platform geospatial desktop application in Java. For lots of examples and documentation go to the project's home page. Or clone the WorldWind Java GitHub repository and start coding.

ISS Streaming Position Data:  http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/
from the site:  The ISS is tracked by several agencies. Both NORAD and NASA periodically publish data about the station. I scrape this page for this API:

* http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/SSapplications/Post/JavaSSOP/orbit/ISS/SVPOST.html

Another popular site for tracking data is celstrak which published NORAD TLE’s:

* http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt

In both cases a “Two Line Element” is used, which contains enough information about an orbit to calculate an objects position at any time within a useful window of accuracy centered around the TLE’s publish date.
